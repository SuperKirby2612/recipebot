# RecipeBot
RecipeBot is a discord bot made for... you guessed it! Giving recipes.<br/>
The bot has a list of youtube food channels and food websites so that there is no innapropiate or off-topic content.<br/>
Right now, the bot is still a work in progress and will be open in beta soon.<br/>

## What I've added for now
• Basic setup (intents, database, message when in new guild.)<br/>
• Recipe Command **BETA**<br/>
– Added **YouTube** support with list of approved channels. (Request a new channel to be added with the creator DM command.)<br/>
– Added basic **Website** support, only supports one site for both languages. (GialloZafferano)<br/>
• Creator DM command - This command is used to minimise my spam and be able to sort my messages into differents categories.<br/>
• Config Command - This command is used to configure your user settings which are synced across guilds.<br/>
• Added support for Italian language.<br/>

## What I need/want to add
• Recommended Recipes command - Get a random recipe which is on a list of recipes (Request a new recipe to be added with the creator DM command.)<br/>

This project was actually lost due to technical errors although most files were recovered successfully because they were stored in Visual Studio<br/> Code's cache. Only 3 files were lost (db.js, test.js and ban-dms.js), I remade db.js and actually improved it, test.js was obviously <br/>just a test file and ban-dms.js was a personal command that could be used only by me, so It wasn't important but I will probably remake it anyways.

**Thanks for reading**, the bot isn't public yet so you can't DM using the Creator DM command. In the meanwhile, send me a message at kirbodev#0001 on Discord (and just in case it changes my id is 695228246966534255)!
